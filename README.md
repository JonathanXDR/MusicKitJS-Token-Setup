Very simple example of working with apple musicKit. Development only


## Development

 - put your [private key in](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devce5522674) a `apple_private_key.p8` file in the root directory
 - add your team & app id's in `server.js`  

```
const team_id = 'ABCDEFGHIJ';
const key_id = 'KLMNOPQRST';
```

- run `node server.js` to start
- the `music` variable will be globally exposed in the javascript console to mess around with
